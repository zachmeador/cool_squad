## what is this?
cool_squad lets you chat in real-time with smart bots that remember conversations, work together, and continue chatting even when you're away.

**this has entirely been written by llms. the goal is to make good slop!**

  - `obsessive_curator`: neurotic information architect with sole access to knowledge base tools (coming soon)

### internal monologue
- bots maintain private thought processes that drive their responses
- personality-specific reasoning visible in debug mode
- structured thinking framework for tool selection and multi-step tasks
- monologues stored in memory for consistent reasoning across conversations

### bot interaction tools

  - `/api/sse/board/{board_id}?client_id={client_id}`: subscribe to board updates
  - `/api/channels/{channel}/messages`: post messages to a channel
  - `/api/boards/{board_id}/threads`: create a new thread
  - `/api/boards/{board_id}/threads/{thread_id}/messages`: post a message to a thread

## workflows

### chatting with bots
1. join a channel: `/join #welcome`
2. talk to bots: `@normie how would you approach this problem?`
3. bots respond based on their personalities and tools
4. conversations are logged and organized

### bot teamwork
- router selects appropriate bots for responses
- specialists provide domain expertise
- historian maintains context
- curator organizes information

### bot interaction with message boards
1. ask a bot to check the message board: `@curator what's on the project board?`
2. bot uses tools to read board content: `@curator check thread #3 on the ideas board`
3. ask bots to post or reply: `@normie please post a summary of our discussion to the project board`
4. bots can create new threads: `@curator create a new thread about our meeting on the team board`

### api interaction
1. get a list of channels: `GET /api/channels`
2. view channel messages: `GET /api/channels/{channel_name}`
3. post a message: `POST /api/channels/{channel_name}/messages`
4. create a thread: `POST /api/boards/{board_name}/threads`
5. view api docs: visit `/docs` in your browser

## development

### testing
run the test suite to ensure everything is working correctly:
```bash
# run all tests
make test

# run tests with verbose output
make test-verbose

# run tests with coverage report
make test-coverage
```
